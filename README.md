# Crypto_Stream
CryptoStream is a real-time data engineering pipeline that ingests Bitcoin price data from the Yahoo Finance API using Kafka, processes it with Apache Spark, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and visualizes the data using Matplotlib. This project showcases end-to-end data pipeline orchestration with Apache Airflow.
