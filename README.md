# Crypto_Stream
CryptoStream is a real-time data engineering pipeline that ingests Bitcoin price data from the Yahoo Finance API using Kafka, processes it with Apache Spark, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and visualizes the data using Matplotlib. This project showcases end-to-end data pipeline orchestration with Apache Airflow.

# üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Data Ingestion: Fetches Bitcoin price data (1-minute intervals) from Yahoo Finance API.

Streaming: Kafka acts as the message broker, streaming data to Spark in real-time.

Processing: Spark cleans and transforms the data.

Storage: Processed data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.

Visualization: Plotly generates interactive visualizations for price trends.

Orchestration: Airflow manages and schedules the entire pipeline.
